### The RepoSeed Vision

RepoSeed is a personal project. From our current viewpoint, its role is:

Start with the base layer necessary to focus on your project and not on the repository.
Licensing, structure, documentation and more boilerplate to get you started from your first commit.


Our detailed items:
* Generic seed files for a useful base* Additions to reposeed only for generic usage* Default useage on first initialization* Specific additions should be added to the files after generation

### Core Concept

Reposeed&#39;s core concept is to provide a basic selection of useful templates. With the help of a configuration file and a small substitution engine the project generates a seed layer for new open source repositories.

### General Aim
Our aim is to provide a sufficient base to built a new open source project on top of. Reducing the burden for maintainers and decreasing the hurdles to get started.

### Communication
A lot of discussion about RepoSeed happens within GitHub issues. Ideally, we will keep it that way until RepoSeed becomes big enough that this turns into a problem. The advantages of this is that all documentation and issues are publicly searchable and easily linked to the source code.

### Contributions
The RepoSeed project should always aim to devote a lot of time to making contributors feel like an important part of the community. We should strive to provide a place for anyone to be able to contribute. The aim of the core team should be to work on ways to showcase contributions, encourage adoption and show off great work. An example of where this worked is the [CocoaPods Quality Index](http://blog.cocoapods.org/CocoaPods.org-Two-point-Five/).
