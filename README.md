# RepoSeed
Start with the base layer necessary to focus on your project and not on the repository.
Licensing, structure, documentation and more boilerplate to get you started from your first commit.



## Using RepoSeed

```git clone https://github.com/okkur/reposeed.git```  
```mkdir your-project-repository```  
```cp seed-config.example.yaml your-project-repository/.seed-config.yaml```  
Fill in your project&#39;s data and remove unnecessary configuration  
```cd your-project-repository```  
```go run cmd/generator.go --input=../reposeed/templates```  
Refine your new base repository to your specific needs


Take a look at our full [documentation](/docs).
