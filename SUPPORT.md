# Support/questions

Non technical or user centric support might be available from the community members on the mailing list, StackOverflow or within our {{ chat-link }}.

Our issue tracker is available for technical discussions and contributions surrounding the {{ project }}, not for user support.

If you're unsure where to post, post to the [mailing list][{{ support-mailinglist-link }}] or [Stack Overflow][{{ stack-overflow-link }}] first. There are a lot of helpful volunteers there who may be able to help you quickly. If your particular issue turns out to be a bug, it will find its way from there.

If it happens that you know the solution to an existing bug, please first open the issue in order to keep track of it and then open the relevant pull/merge request that potentially fixes it.

Please remember this is a community project and you are not entitled to free support. Be kind to anyone helping out and for commercial interests reach out for commercial support at {{ commercial-support-email }}.
