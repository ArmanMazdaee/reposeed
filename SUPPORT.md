# Support/questions

Non technical or user centric support might be available from the community members on the mailing list, StackOverflow or within our $CHAT.

Our issue tracker is available for technical discussions and contributions surrounding the $PROJECT, not for user support.

If you're unsure where to post, post to the [mailing list][$LINK] or
[Stack Overflow][$LINK] first. There are a lot of helpful volunteers
there who may be able to help you quickly. If your particular issue turns out
to be a bug, it will find its way from there.

If it happens that you know the solution to an existing bug, please first
open the issue in order to keep track of it and then open the relevant pull/merge
request that potentially fixes it.

Please remember this is a community project and you are not entitled to free support. Be kind to anyone helping out and for commercial interests reach out for commercial support to $EMAIL.
